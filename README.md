# Project Labyrinth, Week 16, Technigo Bootcamp 

Create a classic text-based maze game providng the user with  with a description of where they are and provide several alternatives about what they can do. 

## The problem

- How to make API calls around Redux using thunks
- How to structure your redux store to suit your data
- To send JSON in the body of a request

Requirements: 
- Page should be responsive.
- Use redux to store the current state of the game
- Handle the response delay
- Use thunks to wrap your API calls 


Stretch goals: 
- Present clear and simple actions.Your button would say for example *"Go East"*. 
- Use redux to store a history of what the player has done
- If you want to focus more on design and make or use a design library (we used NES for 80s feeling of the game)
